### The way I brag about this site on my resume is as follows:
- Engineered responsive user interfaces optimized for seamless performance across various devices and screen sizes.
- Designed and implemented a modern, visually engaging landing page leveraging popular JavaScript frameworks like React, integrating tools such as styled-components and Router for dynamic and efficient development.
- Developed a bold, maximalist front-end to highlight my expertise, creating a memorable user experience that effectively combines aesthetics with functionality.
